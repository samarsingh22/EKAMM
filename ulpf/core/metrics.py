"""Prometheus metrics for ULPF.

All metrics are module-level singletons registered on the default registry, so
any stage can ``from ulpf.core import metrics`` and record without wiring.
``snapshot`` gives the API a plain dict for a JSON endpoint; the standard
Prometheus exposition format is still available via ``prometheus_client``.
